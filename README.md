## What's Office Hours?
Friday traffic sucks. Let it die down - we're having Office Hours.

Office Hours is a weekly-ish impromptu micro-conference for the gridlock-averse. Grab your laptop and some beers, here's a chance to check out something cool your colleagues are working on. 

Format is informal, and topics are technical. Show off something you're working on, or share something you've learned. Frameworks, techniques, useful hacks, dangerous toys and bad ideas are all welcome. Come armed with questions and ideas.
